## Purpose
As a professional chef coming into Data Science; my main goal for my career is to fuse my two passions in order to aid in tackling food accessbility and sustanibilty. My first step towards that journey is with this Module 4 project. I've downloaded data that includes information on honey bees in various region in the United States as well as images of those bees.

My goal with the project is to craft and hone into my own personal work flow; while also starting to get into the mind set that will allow me to succeed in moving on towards tackling deeper issues in this broad category of food sustainability. 

The original data set can be found on [Kaggle here](https://www.kaggle.com/jenny18/honey-bee-annotated-images).

# Main Questions:
***Let's talk about why this is important:*** pollination is one of the first steps of the food supply chain; and with a continuously growing population it is imperative that we come up with creative and sustainable solutions for Food Accessability. 

In order to have better grasp on the problem as a whole; I've chosen many aspects to dig into for my projects. Farmer's Markets; Honey Bee Health; Transportation and Distribution; and other topics that come to me over time. 

Bee's are vital to global food production; and we should be finding and protecting these Honey Bees at any cost.

#### EDA

When I first loaded in the dataset; I investigated geographical dispersement of the data as well as their respective recorded bee counts.

After cleaning and visualizing, I found that the Italian Honey Bee reigns Queen as the most common species in the data set.

Most interestingly though; I found that of our more than 5,000 instances- there were only 18 bees recorded as pollen carrying. This is despite that two-thirds of the bees are classified as healthy bees.

#### Conclusion

After cleaning and exploring the data, I found that while there are more Italian Honey Bees than any other species; they are not recording as pollen-carrying at a high enough count. I would like to dive more into the resistance of the Italian Honey Bee in the future in order to determine which regions would be best for pollination.

# Future Work
- Further Model Work
- Bring in information from other seasons
- Investigate seasonal distribution and effect
- Look into honey production in these areas
- Look into subspecies health tolerance
- Diversify the dataset to include more regions
